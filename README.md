# dholab/baits

`dholab/baits` will build auditable Bait Sets of Clean K-mers for biological targets. It will remove Candidate K-mers that have exact matches in configured Interference Backgrounds. When a Taxonomic Reference Database is supplied, it will then apply Taxonomic Exact-Match Screening.

This repository validates Source Sequence inputs but does not yet contain an analysis workflow.

For one curated execution, supply a Curated Source Sequence FASTA, the Target Taxon, and one Interference Background FASTA:

```bash
nextflow run dholab/baits \
    --source_sequences sources.fasta \
    --target_taxid 88456 \
    --interference_background interference.fasta
```

For one or more executions, use `--input` with a CSV samplesheet. See `assets/schema_input.json` for its columns. Query-guided rows refer to a separate query-rules TSV defined by `assets/schema_query_rules.json`.

`assets/cyclospora_rrna_query_rules.tsv` contains the real query configuration from the Cyclospora rRNA study. It is not a test fixture and does not include the reference sequence files required to run the study.

Run the pipeline with Nextflow:

```bash
nextflow run dholab/baits --help
nextflow run dholab/baits --version
```

## Development

Pixi provides the locked development and test environments. It is not required to run the pipeline.

Install the development environments:

```bash
pixi install --locked
```

Inspect the local checkout:

```bash
pixi run nextflow run . --help
pixi run nextflow run . --version
```

Run the project tests:

```bash
pixi run --environment dev nf-test test
```

The project uses nf-core-compatible components, nf-schema for parameter validation, and nf-test for workflow tests.
